#  Welcome to My User Dashboard!

Hey there! I'm Tejaswini Koppada, and this is my React-based User Dashboard project. I built this as part of my frontend internship assignment, and I'm excited to share it with you!

##  What Can This App Do?

This dashboard isn't just any ordinary dashboard - it's a user-friendly interface where you can:
-  View all users in a clean, card-based layout
-  Search for users by their name (super handy when you have lots of users!)
-  Add new users with a simple form
-  Works perfectly on your phone or desktop
-  Click on any user to see their complete details

##  Here's What It Looks Like
